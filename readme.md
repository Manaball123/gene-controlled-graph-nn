# tldr 
iterations of network are constructed by genes that are set at beginning of iteration  
weights of network are changed during the iteration to mimick learning(changes are gene dependent)  
after each iteration good genes stay and bad genes go bye bye  
the network is a graph, which makes it hard to analyze but its closer to the human brain architecture so  
make agi commit mass genocide etc etc  


# wtf is in this thing

## NN namespace - neural network 
everything related to the network itself is in the NN namespace

### Network 
its the network... 

### Neuron
also self explanatory 

### Connection
ok i think this might need some explaining
a connection object is basically a edge in graph
there are multiple connection types however

#### Simple 
Propagates and changes its weight when backpropagated

#### Hardwired 
Propagate but weight stays constant 

#### placeholder

maybe more will be added idk 

## World namespace - world for the thingys

basically the simualtion space. i havnt wrote anything yet so nothing can be said about it
